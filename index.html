      <p>
        Introduced in 1965 by Dow Chemical Company, chlorpyrifos quickly became
        one of the most widely used pesticides in the United States and
        worldwide. This organophosphate insecticide has been applied to
        everything from corn and soybeans to fruit orchards and golf courses.
        Despite its effectiveness as a pest control solution, though, lies a
        troubling side effects of neurological damage, environmental
        persistence, and environmental justice concerns. For decades,
        scientists, environmental advocates, and affected communities have
        raised concerns about CPF's impacts on human health and ecosystems.
        Despite mounting evidence of its dangers, particularly to developing
        brains, the regulation of this chemical has been marked by political
        battles, industry influence, and delayed protections.

      <h2>Human Health Effects</h2>
      <p>
        Chlorpyrifos belongs to the organophosphate class of pesticides, which
        function by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme crucial
        for nervous system function. This leads to an accumulation of
        acetylcholine at nerve endings, disrupting normal nerve impulse
        transmission. While this mechanism effectively kills insects, it poses
        significant risks to humans exposed to the chemical.
      </p>
      <p>
        Studies have consistently demonstrated that prenatal exposure to
        chlorpyrifos can have profound and lasting impacts on brain development.
        Research has shown that even low levels of CPF can affect brain
        structure in kids 5.9-11.2 yrs old. Significant shape changes in several
        parts of the brain such as the superior temporal, superior frontal
        gyrus, and cortical thickness can also affect children's
        sound/touch/motor functions, language, sensory, spatial awareness,
        decision-making, memory, and attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chlorpyrifos and its metabolites have been widely detected in human
        urine, blood, and cord blood samples across diverse populations
        (including urban and rural), confirming widespread human exposure.
        Studies show that after residential use was banned in 2000, levels
        decreased in the general population but remained significant among
        agricultural communities.

      <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
      <p>
        CPF poses severe threats to ecosystems beyond its target pests. When
        applied to crops or other areas, this persistent chemical doesn't remain
        in place as it travels through air, soil, and water, often detected
        hundreds of miles from application sites. In aquatic environments, CPF
        is particularly devastating, with studies showing it's toxic to fish,
        amphibians, and aquatic invertebrates at concentrations as low as parts
        per trillion. The pesticide bioaccumulates in tissues and biomagnifies
        up the food chain, meaning top predators may have dangerous
        concentrations even when environmental levels appear low.
      </p>
      <p>
        The environmental persistence of chlorpyrifos compounds these ecological
        concerns. With a half-life ranging from 7-120 days depending on the
        conditions, CPF can remain active in soils for a long time, continuing
        to affect microorganisms that are essential for nutrient cycling and
        plant health. Water monitoring programs have detected CPF in
        groundwater, streams, and coastal waters throughout agricultural
        regions. Research has also demonstrated that the chemical can volatilize
        after application, drifting into non-target areas including protected
        habitats and residential communities. This widespread contamination
        creates ripple effects throughout food webs, potentially destabilizing
        ecosystem functions.

              further reduce pesticide exposures by limiting the registered uses
